This plugin provides advanced country selector for Grails. It is suitable for all forms where the user needs to put a country, i.e. address form. Contrary to traditional html select with a huge list of countries, it serves a user normal input box where the user can type his country. When he starts typing it suggest him possible countries he could fill in.

It uses JavaScript autocomplete to give the user right help. The autocomplete takes into account country name alternatives and different relevance for different countries (see [Countries i18n|guide:countries_i18n] chapter). Moreover, it allows i18n localization of country names, alternatives and also relevancy.

The plugin is based on JavaScript implementation of country selector of [Baymard Institute|http://baymard.com/], see project on [Github|https://github.com/JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete].
